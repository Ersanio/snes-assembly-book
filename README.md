# Assembly for the SNES
This is the Git repository of my "Assembly for the SNES" 65c816 ASM tutorial, which is mostly updated and rewritten, compared to the one [hosted at SMW Central](https://www.smwcentral.net/?p=section&a=details&id=14268). The tutorial has been open sourced so that the SNES emulation community may improve upon it. 

This online, open-source version of the tutorial can be accessed here: https://ersanio.gitbook.io/assembly-for-the-snes/

# Code of conduct
Please open a pull request or an issue in the following situations:

* In case of errors in the chapters

* In case of newly written chapters

Please provide details as well if possible and necessary. For example, explain why something is an error and if you have verified it or not, or explain why a new chapter is needed.
